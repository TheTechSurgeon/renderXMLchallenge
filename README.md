This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hello! I built this app in response to a challenge from Tim Bray. I wanted to see how difficult it is to use XML and convert it to something easier like JSON.
The project gets an RSS feed and creates a JSON object out of it, it then renders that object as card react components with embedded players. Currently working on a library that will find the embeddable link for each podcast rss feed.  
## Available Scripts

### `NPM start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `NPM build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
